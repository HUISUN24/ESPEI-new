What's New
==========

0.5 (2018-04-02)
================

* Parameter selection now uses the corrected AIC, which further prevents overparameterization where there is sparse training data.
* Activity and single phase thermochemical data can now be included in MCMC fitting runs. Including single phase data can help anchor metastable phases to DFT data when they are not on the stable phase diagram. See the `Gathering input data <http://espei.org/en/latest/input_data.html>`_ documentation for information on how to input activity data.
* Dataset checking has been improved. Now there are checks to make sure sublattice interactions are properly sorted and mole fractions sum to less than 1.0 in ZPF data.
* Support for fitting phases with arbitrary pycalphad Models in MCMC, including (charged and neutral) species and ionic liquids. There are several consequences of this:
  - ESPEI requires support on ``pycalphad >=0.7``
  - ESPEI now uses pycalphad ``Model`` objects directly. Using the JIT compiled Models has shown up to a *50% performance improvement* in MCMC runs.
  - Using JIT compiled ``Model`` objects required the use of ``cloudpickle`` everywhere. Due to challenges in overriding ``pickle`` for upstream packages, we now rely solely on ``dask`` for scheduler tasks, including ``mpi`` via ``dask-mpi``. Note that users must turn off ``work-stealing`` in their ``~/.dask/config.yaml`` file.


* [Developers] Each method for calculating error in MCMC has been moved into a module for that method in an ``error_functions`` subpackage. One top level function from each module should be imported into the ``mcmc.py`` and used in ``lnprob``. Developers should then just customize ``lnprob``.
* [Developers] Significant internal docs improvements: all non-trival functions have complete docstrings.

0.4.1 (2018-02-05)
==================

* Enable plotting of isothermal sections with data using ``dataplot`` (and ``multiplot``, etc.)
* Tielines are now plotted in ``dataplot`` for isothermal sections and T-x phase diagrams
* Add a useful ``ravel_conditions`` method to unpack conditions from datasets

0.4 (2017-12-29)
================

* MCMC is now deterministic by default (can be toggled off with the ``mcmc.deterministic`` setting).
* Added support for having no scheduler (running with no parallelism) with the ``mcmc.scheduler`` option set to ``None``. This may be useful for debugging.
* Logging improvements

  - Extraneous warnings that may be confusing for users and dirty the log are silenced.
  - A warning is added for when there are no datasets found.
  - Fixed a bug where logging was silenced with the dask scheduler

* Add ``optimal_parameters`` utility function as a helper to get optimal parameter sets for analysis
* Several improvements to plotting

  - Users can now plot phase diagram data alone with ``dataplot``, useful for checking datasets visually. This changes the API for ``dataplot`` to no longer infer the conditions from an equilibrium ``Dataset`` (from pycalphad). That functionality is preserved in ``eqdataplot``.
  - Experimental data points are now plotted with unique symbols depending on the reference key in the dataset. This is for both phase diagram and single phase parameter plots.
  - Options to control plotting parameters (e.g. symbol size) and take user supplied Axes and Figures in the plotting functions. The symbol size is now smaller by default.

* Documentation improvements for API and separation of theory from the Cu-Mg example
* Fixes a bug where elements with single character names would not find the correct reference state (which are typically named GHSERCC for the example of C).
* [Developer] All MCMC code is moved from the ``paramselect`` module to the ``mcmc`` module to separate these tasks
* [Developer] Support for arbitrary user reference states (so long as the reference state is in the ``refdata`` module and follows the same format as SGTE91)

0.3.1.post2 (2017-10-31)
========================

* Propogate the new entry point to setup.py

0.3.1.post1 (2017-10-31)
========================

* Fix for module name/function conflict in entry point

0.3.1 (2017-10-31)
==================

* ESPEI is much easier to run interactively in Python and in Jupyter Notebooks
* Reference data is now included in ESPEI instead of in pycalphad
* Several reference data fixes including support for single character elements ('V', 'B', 'C', ...)
* Support for using multiprocessing to parallelize MCMC runs, used by default (@olivia-higgins)
* Improved documentation for installing and developing ESPEI

0.3.post2 (2017-09-20)
======================

* Add input-schema.yaml file to installer

0.3.post1 (2017-09-20)
======================

* Add LICENSE to manifest

0.3 (2017-09-20)
================

* **ESPEI input is now described by a file.** This change is breaking. Old command line arguments are not supported. See `Writing input files <http://espei.org/en/latest/writing_input.html>`_ for a full description of all the inputs.
* New input options are supported, including modifying the number of chains and standard deviation from the mean
* ESPEI is now available on conda-forge
* TinyDB 2 support is dropped in favor of TinyDB 3 for conda-forge deployment
* Allow for restarting previous mcmc calculations with a trace file
* Add Cu-Mg example to documentation

0.2.1 (2017-08-17)
==================

Fixes to the 0.2 release plotting interface

* ``multiplot`` is renamed from ``multi_plot``, as in docs.
* Fixed an issue where phases in datasets, but not in equilibrium were not plotted by dataplot and raised an error.

0.2 (2017-08-15)
==================

* New ``multiplot`` interface for convienent plotting of phase diagrams + data. ``dataplot`` function underlies key data plotting features and can be used with ``eqplot``. See their API docs for examples. Will break existing code using multiplot.
* MPI support for local/HPC runs. Only single node runs are explictly supported currently. Use ``--scheduler='MPIPool'`` command line option. Requires ``mpi4py``.
* Default debug reporting of acceptance ratios
* Option (and default) to output the log probability array matching the trace. Use ``--probfile`` option to control.
* Optimal parameters are now chosen based on lowest error in chain.
* Bug fixes including
   
   - py2/3 compatibiltiy
   - unicode datasets
   - handling of singular matrix errors from pycalphad's ``equilibrium``
   - reporting of failed conditions

0.1.5 (2017-08-02)
==================

* Significant error checking of JSON inputs.
* Add new ``--check-datasets`` option to check the datasets at path. It should be run before you run ESPEI fittings. All errors must be resolved before you run.
* Move the espei script module from ``fit.py`` to ``run_espei.py``.
* Better docs building with mocking
* Google docstrings are now NumPy docstrings

0.1.4 (2017-07-24)
